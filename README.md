## Dredging_A.Sepehri

This repository is created to give updates about maintenance dredging strategies which is the main idea of my Ph.D. project.

Maintenance dredging is conducted to maintain the available water depth in ports and waterways which leads to keeping the ports and waterways accessible for large draught vessesls. These strategies include 
* Reallocation of sediments (using trailing suction hopper dredgers and mechanical dredging)
* Remobilizing of sediments (water injection dredging, recirculation dredging, and bed leveling)
* Bypassing sediments (sediment wash-out jet system, stationary submersible pump system)
* Anti-sedimentation structures (sediment trap, air bubble screen, current deflecting wall)

Port processes corresponding to maritime logistics include berthing, anchoraging, loading/unloading cargo, vessel turnaround, etc.

The aim of this project is to select the most sustainable, circular, and smart strategy for maintaining ports and waterways when the performance of port processes is optimized. When proposing this framework, different parameters for each strategy should be measured to make a comprehensive trade-off between different criteria of sustainability, circularity, and smartness. These parameters are indicated as follows.
* Production of each strategy or its efficiency in reallocating, remobilizing, bypassing, and preventing sediments to keep the required available water depth.
* Total costs associated with each strategy (e.g. operational costs, upperhand costs, stakeholders satisfaction, etc.)
* Total energy consumption corresponding to each strategy (fuel consumption, total installed power, etc.)
* Total emissions of greenhouse gases for each strategy (CO2, PM10, NOX)

Based on the significance of each of these parameters for dredging companies and port authorities as an alliance, the best strategy will be selected to keep the port accessible. Different conditions can be included in the modelling such as tidal window calculations, weather condition (wind velocity), current velocity, traffic of vessels in a port, rate of resedimentation, etc.

The following picture can show a simple indication of this project.
