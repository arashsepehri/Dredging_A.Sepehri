    "### Production of Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger (TSHD) and Water Injection Dredgers (WID)\n",

    "#### Production of TSHD\n",
    "\n",
    "Production rate of trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHDs) is a metric for calculating the amount of dredged sediments during a single dredging cycle. The higher the production rate of TSHDs, the less time will be spent for conducting the project. The production of TSHDs varies over time based on the sailing distance to discharging area, capacity of hopper, operational hours, and sediment characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, basic parameters related to vessel characteristics and the time required for loading, sailing (full and empty), and unloading are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production of WID\n",
    "\n",
    "Production rate of water injection dredgers (WIDs) is a meteric for calculating the amount of sediments washed out from the water column during a single dredging cycle. The production of WIDs is mainly dependent on the penetration depth of the jet bar and the trailing velocity of vessel. Also, the width of jet bar is a determining factor in measuring the production. The overlap between two adjoining dredging tracks is subtracted from jet bar width to estimate the correct rate of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, basic parameters related to vessel characteristics are developed for calculating the production rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that the sediment to be dredged in the system mainly contains soft sediments which is the case for maintenance dredging. Also, the project is perfomed continuously in time. Therefore, the dredging cycle is continouos and the production rate is calculated for each dredging cycle which gives us an insight into comparing the production in different cycles."
